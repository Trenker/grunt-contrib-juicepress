This is a [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task for blog generation using [juicepress](https://github.com/trenker/juicepress)

## Installation

Have the `grunt` package already installed and write

```bash
npm install --save grunt-contrib-juicepress
```

Now you have the `juicepress` task available.

## Usage

Use a simple grunt config to load markdown posts.

```js
grunt.task.loadNpmTasks("grunt-contrib-juicepress");

grunt.config.init({
  juicepress: {
  	test: {
  	  options: {
  	    baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000/",
  	    layoutsDirectory: "./src/templates/**.*",
  	    buildDirectory: "./_build/"
  	  },
  	  files: [
        {
          cwd: "./posts",
          src: "**/*.md",
          expand: true
        }
  	  ]
  	}
  }
})

```

This example sets up the task `juicepress:test` and the generated pages will contain the default [grunt-connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) url as base so you can start right away.

For a full list of supported options, please see <https://github.com/trenker/juicepress>

:bangbang: IMPORTANT: juicepress ignores the "dest" setting of grunt. Instead it will create pages and directories inside the `buildDirectory` based on categories and title of the post.
